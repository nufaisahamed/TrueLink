# TrueLink

TrueLink is a full-stack web application built with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.
Government projects often suffer from a lack of transparency, leading to inefficiencies, 
limited public participation, and potential corruption. TRUELINK is a digital platform 
designed to foster accountability by bridging the gap between government authorities, 
contractors, and citizens. It provides real-time project tracking, transparent tendering 
processes, and a citizen reporting system. 
 
TRUELINK empowers citizens by allowing them to monitor project progress, report issues 
with photo/video evidence, and access detailed expenditure reports. Contractors can submit 
tenders, track project expenses, and ensure compliance with project guidelines. Government 
officials benefit from centralized project management, data analytics, and fraud detection 
mechanisms, promoting responsible resource utilization. 
 
By leveraging modern web technologies such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB, TRUELINK 
ensures a seamless, secure, and scalable platform. Its impact extends to improving public 
trust, reducing corruption, and enhancing the overall efficiency of government initiatives.
